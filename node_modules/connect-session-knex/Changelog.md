**1.7.0**

- Added Typescript lib interface (index.d.ts)
- Added Airbnb Eslint configs and recommendations.
- Auto fixed many lint errors
- Removed NodeJS v8 testing from Travis
- Added instructions for testing
- Tests now require a password when running locally (While still the same when running on Travis) I did that because both dbs refused to connect locally without a password
- Auto lint both examples
- Moved many functions out of the lib's main closure, to make the code more clear and enforce the purity of these functions. Only the Store class is what remains in the closure (Because it requires the session object)
- Added knex to main dependencies instead of dev dependencies.
